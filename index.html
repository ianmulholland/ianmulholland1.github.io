                                As a 7 year old tearing through packs of cards, I obsessed over completing sets of players and teams. I was facinated with the rich stories that baseball cards told of players teams, and eras. The basic and advanced statistics on the back, the player's facial hair from the photograph on the front, and the short biography at the top of the card all all contributed to the tapestry of baseball history and lore.

                                    It was this early facination with the information and data on baseball cards that led me to become fascinated by measurement and data collection. After graduating from Ohio State, I moved to India for several years; first acting in assessing technology fit for USAID with MIT CITE and then working at a grassroots NGO, SEWA, where I built and managed the impact measurement and data collection work. I saw how robust data and information systems can transform grassroots organizations in order to make better decisions and deliver more effective solutions. I returned to my native city of Boston to apply these learnings at MIT Solve, MIT's flagship social impact organization. There I continued to see the need and necessity for impact measurement systems that fulfill the needs of implementing organizations.

                                        I am now a first year graduate student at University California's I School, where I am on a mission to transform impact measurement from a descriptive practice to an inferential one, that can help community-focused organizations deliver services better. I am particularly interested in the role of data analytics and information architecture in the development sector.
